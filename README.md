# Geometry Based network simplification
## Project Summary
*[_Part of GSoC2022 / PySAL / momepy_](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/proposals/details/CgXX3BjY)*

The aim of this project was to explore different routes for simplifying a road network (mostly) for morphological analysis. My specific approcah was soley on geometry based operations. In summary, one PR has been merged into the main momepy code and has set the grounds of some further explorations; some of which have also made tier way into draft PRs that will be further developed past official end of GSOC2022. The accepted code was approached on the basis of developing a solution that is not only source agnostic, but also scallable. The main logic has been set by a combination of ideas by all parties; from the starting idea of polygonizing the network to the application of COINS algorithms, all the way to grouping adjacent error areas or even using the developed logic to rethinking remaining errorsâ€¦ it all has been a group effort by the whole team (see [agknowledgements](##agknowledgements) below). 

[Next steps](##next-steps) are crucial for the completion of the end goal. Therefore, I have left some suggestions to mark a stepping stone of what it is expected to be a cause that would benefit quite a few, as demonstrated by the interest of many (see relevant [discussion](https://github.com/pysal/momepy/discussions/361)).

## Agknowledgements

Admittedly, I would have liked to had more tangible results. Fortunately, as proven by many other pysal developers, ther contributions during previous GSOC periods have only been the beginnings of something larger.



## Repo file structure
This repository contains data, notebooks and general work in progress to the development of methods for road network simplifications.
- */[data](https://github.com/gregmaya/gsoc2022_network_simpl/tree/main/data)* : containing files used for testing.
- */[exploratory_notebooks](https://github.com/gregmaya/gsoc2022_network_simpl/tree/main/exploratory_notebooks)* : Jupyter Notebooks where the tests and debbugging where performed.

## Next Steps

## Pull Requests (PR)
- [geometry-based simplification of roundabouts #371](https://github.com/pysal/momepy/pull/371)

## Flowcharts
Althought, quite certainly some processes and methods are likely to change, the following are some suggestions to achieve a simplified road network mainly aimed for urban morpholocical analysis.
